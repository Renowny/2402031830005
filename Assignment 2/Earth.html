      <h2>EARTH</h2>
      <p><strong>Earth: Our Home Planet</strong><br>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a unique combination of atmosphere, water, and temperature that makes life possible. About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered by water, with the rest made up of continents and islands. Its atmosphere, rich in nitrogen and oxygen, protects life by filtering harmful radiation and maintaining a stable climate.</p>

      <p>Earth has a solid surface, unlike gas giants, and experiences dynamic geological activity including earthquakes, volcanoes, and plate tectonics. It has a molten core, which generates a magnetic field that shields the planet from solar radiation.</p>

      <p>Earth has one natural satellite—the Moon—which influences tides and helps stabilize the planet’s tilt and climate. The planet takes about 365 days to orbit the Sun and rotates once every 24 hours, creating day and night cycles.</p>

      <p>Earth supports a wide range of ecosystems and millions of species, including humans. It has a diverse climate system with tropical, temperate, and polar zones.</p>

      <p>As humanity’s only home so far, Earth is the focus of environmental conservation efforts due to challenges like pollution, climate change, and habitat loss. It remains a unique and precious world in our solar system—and possibly the universe.</p>
