      <p><strong>Pluto: A Dwarf Planet</strong><br>
        Pluto is a small, icy world located in the Kuiper Belt, a distant region of the solar system beyond Neptune. Discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto was originally classified as the ninth planet. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined what it means to be a planet, and Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet because it hasn’t cleared its orbit of other objects.
Pluto is about 2,377 kilometers wide—much smaller than Earth—and has five known moons. The largest, Charon, is so big relative to Pluto that they orbit each other like a double system. Pluto’s surface features include icy mountains, nitrogen plains, and a heart-shaped region called Tombaugh Regio.
Its orbit is highly elliptical and tilted, and it takes 248 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. Despite its distance and freezing temperatures, Pluto is surprisingly active geologically.
In 2015, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto, capturing detailed images and data that revealed its complex and dynamic surface. Though no longer considered a major planet, Pluto remains a subject of great interest to scientists and continues to inspire curiosity about the outer solar system.</div>
