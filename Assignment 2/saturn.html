      <h2>SATURN</h2>
      <p><strong>Saturn: The Ringed Giant</strong><br>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the solar system, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. Saturn is best known for its spectacular ring system, the most extensive and complex among all the planets. The rings are made of ice, rock, and dust particles that orbit the planet in wide, flat bands.</p>

      <p>Discovered in ancient times and observed by Galileo in 1610, Saturn has fascinated astronomers for centuries. It has a diameter about nine times that of Earth and is over 95 times more massive. Despite its size, Saturn is the least dense planetâ€”it would float in water if a large enough ocean existed!</p>

      <p>Saturn has at least 145 known moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system. Titan has a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes, making it one of the most Earth-like places beyond our planet.</p>

      <p>The Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, provided stunning images and important scientific data about the planet, its rings, and moons. Saturn's beauty, complexity, and unique features continue to make it a favorite among astronomers and space enthusiasts alike.</p>
