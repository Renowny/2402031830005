      <p><strong>Jupiter: The Giant of the Solar System</strong><br>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the solar system. It’s a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with a diameter over 11 times that of Earth and a mass more than 300 times greater. Because of its enormous size and strong gravity, Jupiter has played a major role in shaping the solar system.</p>

      <p>One of Jupiter’s most famous features is the Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries. Its atmosphere is filled with colorful bands of clouds, caused by powerful winds and chemical reactions.</p>

      <p>Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field and more than 90 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system—even bigger than Mercury. Other major moons, known as the Galilean moons, include Io, Europa, and Callisto. Europa is especially interesting to scientists because it may have a subsurface ocean that could harbor life.</p>

      <p>The planet doesn’t have a solid surface, and its fast rotation (a day lasts about 10 hours) causes it to bulge at the equator.</p>

      <p>NASA’s Juno spacecraft is currently studying Jupiter, revealing new insights about its deep atmosphere, magnetic field, and structure.</p>

      <p>Jupiter remains a planet of great mystery and immense power.</p>
