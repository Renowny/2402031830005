      <h2>MERCURY</h2>
      <p><strong>Mercury: The Swift and Scorched Planet</strong><br>
      Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and also the smallest in the solar system. It has no atmosphere to speak of, so temperatures swing dramatically—from about 430°C (800°F) during the day to -180°C (-290°F) at night.Mercury’s surface is covered in craters, similar to Earth’s Moon, due to constant asteroid impacts over billions of years. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet—Venus holds that title.Mercury orbits the Sun quickly, completing one orbit in just 88 Earth days, which earned it the name of the Roman messenger god.
      It has a large iron core that generates a weak magnetic field, and it experiences a phenomenon called "spin-orbit resonance": it rotates three times for every two orbits it makes around the Sun.NASA’s MESSENGER mission provided detailed maps and data about Mercury’s surface, magnetic field, and composition, revealing it as a geologically complex world.</p>
