      <h2>URANUS</h2>
      <p><strong>Uranus: The Tilted Ice Giant</strong><br>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and one of the coldest planets in the solar system. It is classified as an ice giant, along with Neptune, because its interior is made mostly of icy materials like water, ammonia, and methane, rather than gas like Jupiter or Saturn. Uranus was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel, becoming the first planet found with a telescope.</p>

      <p>Uranus is unique because it rotates on its sideâ€”its axis is tilted at about 98 degrees. This extreme tilt likely resulted from a massive collision long ago. As a result, its seasons are very unusual, each lasting over 20 Earth years. A full orbit around the Sun takes about 84 Earth years.</p>

      <p>The planet has a pale blue-green color due to methane in its upper atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue. Although winds and storms occur, they are less visible than on Neptune or Jupiter.</p>

      <p>Uranus has 27 known moons and a faint ring system. Its largest moons include Titania, Oberon, and Miranda. The only spacecraft to visit Uranus was Voyager 2 in 1986, providing most of the data we have today.</p>

      <p>Uranus remains a mysterious and intriguing planet, still awaiting a return mission.</p>
