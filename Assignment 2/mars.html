      <p><strong>Mars: The Red Planet</strong><br>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It is about half the size of Earth and has a thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide. Temperatures on Mars can vary widely, often dropping far below freezing.</p>

      <p>Mars has surface features that resemble both Earth and the Moon. It has mountains, valleys, deserts, and even polar ice caps made of water and dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide). The planet is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris.</p>

      <p>Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos.</p>

      <p>Scientists believe Mars once had liquid water on its surface, and there is strong evidence that water still exists underground, possibly in the form of briny lakes.</p>

      <p>Mars is a major target for exploration because of its potential to support past or present life. Rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance, along with orbiters, have been studying the planetâ€™s geology, climate, and atmosphere.</p>

      <p>Mars is also seen as a possible destination for future human missions, making it one of the most exciting planets in our solar system.</p>
