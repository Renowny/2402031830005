      <h2>VENUS</h2>
      <p><strong>Venus: Earth's Twin with a Fiery Twist</strong><br>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth’s "sister planet" because of its similar size and composition. However, conditions on Venus are extremely hostile. Its thick atmosphere is made mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. This traps heat and makes Venus the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures around 475°C (900°F)—hot enough to melt lead.
        Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets, so a day on Venus is longer than its year. The surface is rocky, with mountains, volcanoes, and vast plains, but it’s hidden under thick clouds, making direct observation difficult.
        Despite its harsh environment, Venus is an important planet to study because it helps scientists understand climate change and planetary evolution. Several missions, including NASA’s Magellan and ESA’s Venus Express, have mapped and analyzed the planet.</p></div>
