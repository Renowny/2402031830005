      <p><strong>The Sun: The Heart of Our Solar System</strong><br>
      The Sun is a massive, glowing ball of hot gas at the center of our solar system. It’s classified as a G-type main-sequence star (or yellow dwarf) and is composed primarily of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%). Through a process called nuclear fusion, the Sun converts hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing enormous amounts of energy as light and heat.</p>

      <p>The Sun’s diameter is about 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles), making it over 100 times wider than Earth. Its gravity holds the entire solar system together, keeping planets, moons, asteroids, and comets in orbit. It provides the energy that drives Earth’s climate, weather, and supports all life.</p>

      <p>The Sun has several layers: the core (where fusion happens), the radiative and convective zones, and the outer layers—the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. The corona is visible during a solar eclipse and can reach temperatures hotter than the surface itself.</p>

      <p>The Sun also produces solar wind—a stream of charged particles that can affect Earth's magnetic field and cause auroras. Though it seems unchanging, the Sun goes through 11-year cycles of activity, including solar flares and sunspots.</p>

      <p>The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and is expected to shine for another 5 billion years.</p>
