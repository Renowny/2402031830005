      <h2>NEPTUNE</h2>
      <p><strong>Neptune: The Windy Blue Giant</strong><br>
        Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is a gas giant and is known for its deep blue color, which comes from the presence of methane in its atmosphere. Neptune was discovered in 1846 through mathematical predictions rather than direct observation, making it the first planet to be located this way.</p>

      <p>Neptune is about four times wider than Earth and has a mass 17 times greater. It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, with incredibly strong winds—the fastest in the solar system—reaching speeds over 2,000 km/h (1,200 mph). These winds help create dark storm systems, similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.</p>

      <p>The planet has 14 known moons, the largest being Triton, which orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet’s rotation, suggesting it may have been captured from the Kuiper Belt. Neptune also has a faint system of rings.</p>

      <p>It takes about 165 Earth years for Neptune to complete one orbit around the Sun. The only spacecraft to visit Neptune was NASA’s Voyager 2 in 1989, providing the first close-up images and valuable scientific data about this distant and mysterious planet.</p>
